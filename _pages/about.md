I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) and 
affiliated with 
[Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/).
My research interest lies in artificial intelligence and computer vision applications in healthcare domain,
especially in utilizing large-scale imaging studies to improve personalize medicine. 
I am advised by [Bennett Landman, PhD](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmTcH0QAAAAJ&hl=en)
and work closely with
[VUMC](https://www.vumc.org/main/home) clinical experts

[Fabien Maldonado, MD, MSc](https://medicine.vumc.org/person/fabien-maldonado-md-msc), 
and [J. Jeffrey Carr, MD, MSc](https://www.vumc.org/vtracc/person/j-jeffrey-carr-md).

Previously, I received my M.Sc. in Computational Mathematics (Computational Fluid Dynamics) from 
[Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science](http://english.amss.cas.cn/)
of [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/). Before joining Vanderbilt, I 
worked as algorithm engineer (3D modeling) at [KLA Corporation](https://www.kla.com/).

Open to work!

I am looking for AI research and engineering job opportunities after graduation. 
In my Ph.D. training, I am primarily focused on the AI research for automatic interpretation of clinical relevant 
incidental image data in routine lung cancer screening low-dose CT. This line of research leads to three conference 
and two journal publications. I am experienced with AI algorithm development, cloud 
computing, large-scale software development in both industrial and academic settings. 

Please feel free to contact me (kaiwen.xu\[at\]vanderbilt\[dot\]edu) if 
there is a potential good fit! Here are my
